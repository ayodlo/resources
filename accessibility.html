Accesibility

Roles - Landmark Roles
<header role="banner />
<navigation role="navigation" />
<main role="main" />
<footer role="contentinfo" />

Links - Aria Labels
Better to put the real text in the link and also use aria label
Make sure you include alt
<a href="#" aria-label="read more about the largest dinosaur" />

Charts and Informational Images
Can create a description list that describes each of the bars in a graph or chart
Should not be hidding the dl, but if you do make sure the html is still visible
<img aria-details="graph-info" />
<dl id="graph info">
  <dt>Jupiter</dt>
  <dd>67 moons</dt>
</dl>


Links - Focus
Make the focus highly contrasting on your site
a:focus {
  outline: 3px solid black;
}


Skip Links
At top of page at the beginning of body we want to add our skip links
You can hide them but they should still be accessible with alot of contrast on our page
<ul class="skip-links">
  <li><a href="#nav>Skip to Navigation</a></li>
  <li><a href="#main>Skip to the main content</a></li>
</ul>

.skip-links {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style-type: none;
  background-color: black;
  padding: 0.5 0.75em;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
}
.skip-links a {
  position: absoulte;
  top: -3em;
}

.skip-links a:focus {
  top: 0;
}

Back to Top Button
<header role="banner" id="top>
<footer>
  <a href="#top" />
< /footer>

Font-Size
Make sure the layout doesn't break if the font-size is changed
Try to increase font size by 2 in the browser options as well as down in the in the browser options
Use tool web-developer tool bar or browser options to remove images and see how website responds, make sure nothing breaks (e.g. make sure nothing dissapears like navigation or background-images)
Use tool Color Oracle to debug color blindness issues you can check for contrast issues
