Given my background in telecommunications, ticketing systems, customer facing support, utilities as well as my recent graduation with a degree in Computer Information Systems (Web Development) I believe I may be a good fit for this position. My college career coupled with my work experience at CenturyLink has given my a wide range of technical capacity (reading and writing code to troubleshooting layer 1 network issues). I am capable of working efficiently and quickly in an organized manner alone or with team members and am always ready to learn new tool sets and workflows. I look forward to learning how I can help your team further its success.

Best Regards,

Devon
