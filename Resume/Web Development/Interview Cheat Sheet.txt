///Obstacle at Work///
When I first came into this project there was an existing codebase that was unorganized and wasn't very modulare. I took it upon myself to use the existing progress as a sort of wire-frame and re-coded the existing app so it would more organized and also made sure all dependencies were up to date. This helped progress moving forward since I no longer had to decipher what component did what and where business logic was.


///Deadline///
My girlfriend got in a car accident a couple years ago while I was on my way to a Stand By as a Watch and Protect Locator for XCEL. As soon as it happened I called my supervisor and explained the situation to him and asked if there was anyone that could help me or if there was a way we could schedule the Stand By for a later time after I made sure Jasmin was okay and had everything she needed. He told me it was fine and that he would take my place at the Stand By.


///Difficult Colleague///
Before I started on Conaxion's project I worked for XCEL Energy's Watch & Protect program. There were many times when contracts would ask us to Stand By for them over night or during the weekend to ensure no gas lines were damaged. I volunteered plenty of times for these over night jobs so that other colleagues who had commitments woulnd't be forced to abondon their family plans or other commitments. In the end everyone was happy and most of the time I got the next work day off.


///Give Example of Teamwork///
Before I started on Conaxion's project I worked for XCEL Energy's Watch & Protect program. There were many times when contractors would ask us to Stand By for them over night or during the weekend and our job was to make sure no gas lines were damaged while they were drilling or digging next to them. I volunteered plenty of times for these over night jobs so that other colleagues who had commitments woulnd't be forced to abondon their family plans or other commitments. In the end everyone was happy and most of the time I got the next work day off.


///What is customer services///
-To me, customer service means identifying the root of a customer’s issue and working to find a solution that surpasses their expectations using in-depth knowledge of the company’s service or product. 
-Its about maintaining a positive and friendly attitude that makes a good first impression and leaves a lasting one.


///Stengths///
I have a hard-working nature;
I have an enthusiastic demeanour;
I am a great team player;
I like to support and help develop others;
I am dependable.
I have a passion for technology
One thing that I feel makes me stand out from the majority of employees is that I am always looking for ways to improve the way I perform at work. If a colleague or manager were to give me some form of constructive criticism I would find a way to improve in whatever in whatever area they felt I needed to improve in, whether it meant finding an online course or reading technical documentation.


///Weaknesses///
- I am a perfectionist and am always eager to complete the task at hand. So sometimes I forget to take a break or eat lunch while Im working.


///Where do you see yourself in 5 years’ time?///
If Im successful today, the first thing I'd want to do is get familiar with the code base and become productive in my role as soon as possible. Once I find a good rythm and am performing the role to a good standard, I'd like to see where I can help others and become experienced within the team. 

So, I guess the short answer to this question is that I want to become good at my job, be accepted by my team and managers and enjoy my work as much as possible.

If the opportunity comes to move up within the organisation, that would be great. All in all, Id like to stay with the company long-term if I make it through these interviews.


//Questions / Comments?///
I just want to say that if I were selected for this position it would be pride and joy, nothing would make me happier. As a team member I want nothing more than to see my team success and would make sure I do everything within my power to make sure we do succeed. 

I hope to make it to the next interview round so I can better demonstrate my skillset through a coding challenge or some technical questions.
